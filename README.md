## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Generative AI  
**Generative AI** refers to AI systems that can create new content ‚Äî **text, images, audio, or code** ‚Äî based on patterns learned from vast datasets.  
The key enabler is the **Transformer architecture**, introduced in *Attention Is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017), which uses **self-attention** to capture long-range dependencies in data.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT-4, operate by:  
- Tokenizing input text into smaller units  
- Processing it through multiple self-attention layers  
- Predicting the most likely next token repeatedly until a full response is formed  

### Why This Matters for ChatGPT & Perplexity AI  
Both platforms share similar **base architectures** but differ in **data freshness**, **retrieval methods**, and **response styles**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ ChatGPT: Overview & Working

**Developer:** OpenAI  
**Architecture:** GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 ‚Äî Transformer-based, decoder-only models  
**Knowledge Source:**  
- Large pre-trained corpus (books, websites, research papers)  
- Optional **browsing mode** for real-time search (if enabled)  

**Working Mechanism:**  
1. **User prompt** is tokenized.  
2. Model processes tokens through stacked transformer layers.  
3. **Self-attention** identifies relationships between words.  
4. Model predicts next tokens until output completion.  

**Strengths:**  
- Exceptional for **creative writing** (stories, poems, scripts)  
- **Programming support** (debugging, code generation)  
- Detailed **concept explanations**  

**Limitations:**  
- Without browsing, knowledge cutoff applies.  
- No built-in citations (unless browsing mode is on).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Perplexity AI: Overview & Working

**Developer:** Perplexity.ai  
**Architecture:** Combines GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 with **real-time search retrieval**  
**Knowledge Source:**  
- Pre-trained LLM knowledge  
- Live web search results with **citations**  

**Working Mechanism:**  
1. **User query** is analyzed.  
2. Search API retrieves top relevant results.  
3. Model summarizes results and **attaches citations**.  

**Strengths:**  
- **Always up-to-date** with real-time info  
- **Citation-based** answers improve reliability  

**Limitations:**  
- Creativity is lower compared to ChatGPT  
- Quality depends on **search result accuracy**
